# ðŸ§  Credit Risk Prediction Model

A machine learning project to predict the likelihood of loan default using applicant data (32,000+ records). The goal is to help financial institutions assess credit risk effectively.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features
- Performed **EDA** with pairplots and heatmaps
- Handled missing values using **KNN Imputer**
- Balanced dataset using **SMOTE**
- Trained models: **KNN**, **Decision Tree**, **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**
- Achieved **93% accuracy** with Random Forest

## ðŸ§ª Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Visualization: Seaborn, Matplotlib
- ML Techniques: SMOTE, KNN Imputer, Random Forest
- Notebook-based implementation

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- High accuracy on imbalanced data
- Clear correlation between income, credit history, and default risk
- Ready for integration into financial decision systems


## âœ… Future Scope
- Add XGBoost/LightGBM
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Deploy using Streamlit
